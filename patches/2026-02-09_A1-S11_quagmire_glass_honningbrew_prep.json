The Glass Double can be invoked to redirect an attack, create confusion about your position, or allow you to appear in two places at once within the same zone. If you take Physical stress or a consequence while the Glass Double is active, it shatters and the aspect is removed (but invokes already spent remain spent). The double cannot take independent actions but responds to your movements as a perfect mirror."
