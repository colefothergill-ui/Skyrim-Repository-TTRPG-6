Gaining a +2 Bonus to Lore 4dF rolls to Attack all enemies with the Fireball in a designated zone of his choosing up to two zones away. Enemies within the zone roll to Defend and take physical stress as normal.

3. Spell of Greater Restoration: Because Oskern's mother was an Imperial Battlemage, he has learned how to mend the wrost of wounds on himself and those around him. Once per Scene, Oskern can channel resotrative Magicka and heal himself or another companion within the same zone for 3 Physical Stress or reduce one Physical Consequence. Severe to Moderate, Moderate to Mild, Mild to None.

**Backstory Summary**: **Civil War Entry**: Oskern�s Response: �My Father, Lord Elitrigg Cindershroud, and my Mother, Lady Audania of Cyrodil, entered me into a raffle called life. Just a jest, but only just. As the heir to Clan Cindershroud and son of the Legendary War Hero, the Dragon of Hjaalmarch, when war broke out, it was inevitable that I would end up in it. The short of it is that I was once Thane of Solitude by the age of 18, accepted and assessed as an Adept of the College of Winterhold at 23, and watched my best friend High King Torygg die at 25. When that happened, my Clan was split between loyalties, you see. My Father, former Patriarch of our Clan, was as close as Kin with Jarl Ulfric, and for that matter, so was I, often referring to him as my Uncle. A fact that, despite how others in my Clan felt about Ulfric after the infamous duel, landed the majority of my Clan on the headman's chopping block. Only I was spared, thanks to Jarl Elisif�s fondness for me and my Mother�s connections to the Septim Dynasty back in Cyrodil. Orchestrating me to be sent to Winterhold, where I have been with the College ever since.

**Civil War Stance**: Oskern�s Response: That... It is a question more than a little complex. On one hand, my Father was a true Son of Skyrim, Talos Worshipper, and Shield-Brother of Uncle Ulfric. On the other hand, High King Torygg  was my childhood friend, and I served Solitude�s bureaucracy proudly, as well as protected Queen Elisif as her pseudo Battle-Mage, for upwards of two years. She, too, is very important to me. So, siding with Ulfric would feel like a betrayal to her and to Torygg, but to take up arms in retribution for them... That would mean betraying my Mother, my Father, my Clan, and Legacy as the next Dragon of Haafingar. All that being said, I serve the College, and the magical pursuits I always wanted as a child, but it feels cowardly.

**Motivation**: Oskern�s Response: �Once upon a time, it was the Legacy of each Dragon of Haafingar, a title bestowed upon my family's Patriarch since the early 3rd Era, with my Ancestor Hakon Cindershroud mastering the Thu�um, and being renowned for protecting Solitude with the Staff of Cinder�s, and the Shout; Yol Tor Shuul! That�s: Fire Breath, in the common tongue. Nowadays, that�s the only Shout required by the Patriarch of Clan Cindershroud to don the title, a Shout I am pleased to say, even as an Imperial, that I have mastered in spades. These days, what drives me is my studies, my dream of becoming a legendary Arch Mage, and perhaps restoring my family�s Nobility when this damnable war is over, and a new High King or Queen is chosen. Talos let that be soon.

**Connections**: Oskern�s Response: �Another, complicated question... Jarl Ulfric helped me hone my Thu�um, rather, he helped me Master Fire Breath�s shout. He is the reason I can wear the Title: Dragon of Haafingar. He was also the closest thing to Kin to my Nord Father, and always treated my Mother, Audania, with the utmost respect, despite the fact that she was an Imperial and the 4th or 5th Cousin of the Emperor of Cyrodil.  For this, he will always be my Uncle. Then there�s Jarl Elisif... I never spoke this aloud, but I was always envious of Torygg, for I truly believe that I had loved Elisif, and she... Well, she never said it outright, but I knew she felt fondly for me on a deep level. Outside of those two, I have friends in my colleagues, Onmund, J�zargo, and my teacher, Tolfdir. Whiterun? Hm, I once met the Harbinger of Jorvaskr with my father when I was but a boy, Kodlak, I think his name is. Beside him, I have spoken to Jarl Balgruuf the Greater, he is a man worthy of his title to say the least.�


## Starting Narrative - Neutral Path

The party arrives in Whiterun, determined to remain independent in the civil war.
The Companions of Jorrvaskr offer a model of honor-bound neutrality, focusing on
warrior traditions rather than politics.

As the Battle of Whiterun approaches, the party must navigate between both sides,
potentially aiding the defense of the city while maintaining independence. They
may seek to minimize bloodshed or focus on protecting civilians caught in the
crossfire.

the Battle of Whiterun will shape Skyrim's future.

## Courtyard Leadership & Wolves on the Road

### Courtyard Speech - Role Assignments
Following the initial setup, Oskern stood before the assembled students in the College courtyard. The expedition south required organization, and as the son of a war hero and a lord of noble lineage, command came naturally—even if it drew unwanted attention.

**Role Assignments**:
- **Scouts**: Faster students tasked with ranging ahead
- **Rear Guard**: Watchful students protecting the column's back
- **Core Formation**: Main group with supply packs
- **Oskern**: Front leadership position

The speech was measured but confident. Students who had been uncertain now had purpose. The formation took shape with surprising discipline.

### Mechanics Block

**Compel Accepted**: "Prove You're Worthy of the Dragon of Haafingar"
- **Fate Point Gained**: +1 FP (total: 3 FP)
- **Scene Aspect Created**: "All Eyes on Cindershroud" (GM-controlled, 1 free invoke)
- **Effect**: Oskern's command presence and noble bearing drew attention from everyone present. His reputation now precedes him on this journey.

**Rapport Roll - Create Advantage**: "Calm Under Command"
- **Roll**: +1 on 4dF + Rapport +3 = +4 vs. Difficulty 2
- **Result**: Success with Style
- **Free Invoke Consumed**: Invoked "Signed for Their Safety" to ensure success
- **Scene Aspect Created**: "Calm Under Command" (2 free invokes)
- **Effect**: Students are organized, roles are clear, formation discipline is reinforced

**Scene Aspect Updated**:
- "Signed for Their Safety" → free invokes reduced to 0 (consumed in Rapport roll)

### Travel Beat: Wolves on the Road

As the expedition descended from Winterhold's frozen heights toward the winding road south, the landscape opened into snow-swept tundra. The cold bit hard, but the formation held.

Then the scouts spotted movement: **ice wolves**, pale as death, shadowing the expedition from rocky outcrops. They didn't attack—not yet—but their presence was unmistakable. Yellow eyes gleamed in the failing light.

The students tensed. Oskern's hand moved instinctively to the Staff of Cinders. The wolves kept pace, watching, waiting.

**Threat Level**: Moderate (wolves are tracking, not yet hostile)
**Next Beat**: Decide whether to press forward, confront the pack, or adjust route
