# Session 00 LATEST — Under Saarthal (2026-02-15)

## One-Page Recap
Oskern led the College expedition from Winterhold to Saarthal, held the students together under pressure, and fought through wolves, wards, and awakened draugr. Deep within the ruins, the party reached a sealed chamber housing the **Eye of Magnus**. Oskern, driven by Atronach hunger but using the **Staff of Cinders** as a controlled conduit, successfully siphoned a measured charge without detonating the containment lattice, creating a stored **Eye-Fed Reservoir**. Ancano attempted to seize authority over the discovery and was publicly checked, forced into observer posture.

## Mechanical Highlights
- **Eye-Fed Reservoir**: 2 charges (PC extra)
- **Eye-Touched Mastery**: 1 charge (PC extra)
- **Ancano Suspicion**: 6/8
- **Ancano Powerplay**: 1/4 (first grab, publicly checked)

## Stop Point
- **Next Scene ID**: A1_S01_SAARTHAL_WITHDRAWAL
- **Location**: Saarthal — Eye Chamber (pre-withdrawal)
- **Objective**: Withdraw from Saarthal with the students and the College's notes. Report the Eye of Magnus discovery to Arch-Mage Savos Aren. Keep Ancano boxed into "observer" status.

## Artifact Event: Staff of Cinders Awakening 6/6

**FEIM. ZII. GRON.**
Unlocked Shout: **Become Ethereal (Feim Zii Gron)**, mastery 0/8.
