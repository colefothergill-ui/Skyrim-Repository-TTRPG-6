## A1-S11 — Mirror Trial: Glass & Honningbrew Meadery Infiltration

### Scene Overview
**Location:** Riften — Ragged Flagon (Cistern) → Whiterun Hold — Honningbrew Meadery (Exterior)  
**Objective:** Complete Mirror Trial (Glass); receive Dampened Spirits assignment from Delvin; prepare for Honningbrew infiltration; initiate and execute meadery operation  
**Outcome:** Mirror Trial completed successfully; Spell of Glass unlocked; Thalmor heat increases; Thalmor Justiciar neutralized via protocol pressure; basement access secured; meadery sabotage completed cleanly

---

### Narrative Summary

Following the successful Goldenglow Estate heist, Insaerndel took a well-earned rest in the relative safety of the Ragged Flagon's cistern quarters. However, rest in the conventional sense was denied — the Spell Tome of Quagmire called, its blank pages demanding another descent into the dream-mirrors of Vaermina's realm.

**Mirror Trial: Glass**

The trial manifested as a hall of crystalline reflections, each mirror showing a different version of Insaerndel — past selves, potential futures, and the masks worn to survive. The challenge centered on confronting self-betrayal and the fragmentation of identity that comes from living behind so many aliases.

**Key Trial Moments:**
- **Reflection Chamber**: Faced reflections of the "Dream Catcher," "Orinthelo," "Insaerndel the Wizard Consultant," and "Brynjolf's Magician" — each accusing the others of being the lie
- **Truth Test**: Required discerning which reflection held genuine memory versus illusionary fabrication
- **Mirror Shattering**: Accepted that all identities are real, none complete — embraced the fragmentation rather than seeking false unity

**Trial Resolution:**
- **Roll 1** (Will - Endure): Success — Withstood the psychological pressure of fractured identity
- **Roll 2** (Lore - Decode): Success — Recognized the trial's symbolic language and Vaermina's lesson about perception
- **Roll 3** (Notice - Spot Truth): Success with Style — Identified the true self as the synthesis of all masks, not a singular core

**Reward:** Spell of Glass unlocked — the ability to create illusionary duplicates through mirrored reflections

---

**Post-Trial: Thieves Guild Business**

Upon waking, Insaerndel found Delvin Mallory waiting with a new opportunity:

**Dampened Spirits - Honningbrew Meadery Job:**
- Maven Black-Briar seeks to cripple the Honningbrew Meadery's reputation and business
- Primary objective: Sabotage the meadery by poisoning their brewing vat with a "special ingredient"
- Secondary objective: Discover who Mallus Maccius (the inside man) is working for
- Decision point: Expose Mallus to Sabjorn or protect him for potential Guild leverage

**Intelligence Gathered:**
- Delvin provided a dossier on Honningbrew's layout, personnel, and security patterns
- The job requires traveling to Whiterun — increased risk given recent Battle aftermath and potential Thalmor presence
- Maven's interest suggests the Honningbrew matter ties into larger Black-Briar business interests

**Complications Accepted:**
- **Compel: "Informants Everywhere"** — Insaerndel's inquiries about Whiterun and Honningbrew in the Ratway did not go unnoticed. Someone will report the Altmer asking pointed questions, advancing the Thalmor search clock.

---

**Honningbrew Meadery Infiltration**

Armed with Delvin's intelligence and the necessary tools, Insaerndel traveled to Whiterun and approached the Honningbrew Meadery. Upon arrival, an unexpected complication presented itself: a Thalmor Justiciar was present, observing the meadery's operations.

**Confronting the Justiciar:**

Rather than risk exposure or violence, Insaerndel employed the Spell of Veils to disguise himself as a Whiterun Guard and used bureaucratic protocol pressure to handle the situation. Invoking guard authority and inspection procedures, Insaerndel successfully forced the Justiciar to observe from the upper level rather than interfere directly in the basement area.

**Outcome:**
- **Success with Style** — The Justiciar complied, securing private access to the basement for conversation with Mallus Maccius
- **New Complication** — The Justiciar began documenting the "inspector's" activities, creating a paper trail that could tie back to the investigation
- **Basement Secured** — Cleared the way for the critical conversation with the inside man without witnesses

This maneuver bought the operational space needed but came at a cost: the Thalmor now have documentation of a "Whiterun Guard inspector" taking unusual interest in Honningbrew's basement operations.

## A1-S13 — Quest Turn-In at the Bee and Barb

### Scene Overview
**Location:** Riften — Bee and Barb  
**Objective:** Report Dampened Spirits completion to Maven Black-Briar; receive payment and any additional intelligence  
**Outcome:** Maven satisfied with clean execution; 600 septim payout awarded; critical Arisann lead acquired (Ivory Thread lattice, Hroldar 'Whitefin' contact, Nightgate Pass)

---

### Narrative Summary

With the Honningbrew operation completed successfully and Mallus secured, Insaerndel returned to Riften to deliver the results to Maven Black-Briar at the Bee and Barb.

**Meeting with Maven:**

Maven received the report with evident satisfaction:
- The Honningbrew Meadery's reputation was in ruins following the official seizure
- Mallus Maccius remained unexposed as her asset
- The operation was clean, with no trail leading back to Black-Briar interests
- Sabjorn faced official consequences while Maven's hand remained hidden

**Maven's Payment and Intel:**

Impressed by the surgical precision of the operation, Maven provided:
- **Payment:** 600 septims (above standard Guild rates)
- **Critical Lead:** Information about the Ivory Thread courier lattice
  - The network operates through The Pale
  - Contact point: Hroldar 'Whitefin' at Nightgate Pass
  - Passphrase protocol: "salt survives the mirror" / reply "then don't blink"
  - Direct connection to Arisann's disappearance

**Negotiation:**

During the conversation, Insaerndel invoked his High Concept ("EX Vaermina Cultist - Turned Daedrologist, Illusionist Extraordinaire, and Cunning Thief") to demonstrate the value of his unique skillset and secure Maven's trust for future intelligence sharing. This expenditure of fate proved worthwhile — Maven confirmed that Mallus would be extracted and placed under Black-Briar protection, preserving him as a long-term asset.

**Outcome:**
- Dampened Spirits quest completed
- Mallus preserved as Maven's insulated asset
- Ivory Thread lead acquired — first solid connection to Arisann's trail
- Maven's disposition toward Insaerndel: Impressed and willing to share actionable intelligence
