## Session Summary

Session 0 pivots the campaign's opening to the **College of Winterhold**, with Oskern already recognized as an **Adept** and pulled immediately into a "you're responsible for the students" kind of situation.

Mirabelle Ervine assigns Oskern as the **expedition lead** for Tolfdir's Saarthal dig, with three students attached to the team:
- **Onmund** (frontline ward support)
- **Brelyna Maryon** (midline utility / stabilization)
- **J'zargo** (rearline artillery / "please don't explode us")  

Oskern signs out a **College-Issued Field Kit**, accepts a **Standing Stone Compel** (Atronach Stone: magicka-starved surge), and clears the immediate exhaustion by downing a **Magicka potion** before departure.

## Scenes Played

### Scene: College Courtyard — Saarthal Briefing
**Scene ID**: `A1_S00_COLLEGE_SAARTHAL_BRIEFING`  
**Objective**: Lead the Saarthal expedition team; reach the dig site and keep the students alive.

**Key beats**
- Mirabelle lays down the rule: the College can tolerate chaos, but not *dead students*. Oskern is accountable.
- Oskern takes the issued satchel and immediately prepares the squad like a battlefield unit (treating the expedition like a disciplined field unit).
- **Compel (Accepted)**: Atronach Stone — sudden magicka-starved surge hits as preparations begin.
  - **Resolution**: Oskern drinks a Magicka potion to clear the immediate exhaustion.
- Oskern establishes expedition formation doctrine and assigns combat roles.

## Fate + Mechanics Snapshot

### Compel Log
- **Atronach Stone: Magicka-Starved Surge** — *Accepted*  
  **Fiction**: the standing stone "eats" the ambient flow; Oskern feels it like thirst behind the eyes.  
  **Cost/Outcome**: cleared with a Magicka potion before leaving the courtyard.

### Scene Aspects (Created)
- **College-Issued Field Kit** (2 free invokes) — signed out supplies (scrolls, potions, emergency gear).
- **Shield-Wall Doctrine** (2 free invokes) — Oskern's formation order for the student team.
- **Signed for Their Safety** (1 free invoke) — Mirabelle's directive and accountability pressure.

### Active Scene Clock
- **Saarthal Expedition Logistics**: 1/4  
  *(1=briefed+supplied; 2=arrive; 3=breach wards; 4=secure exit.)*

---

## Continuity Notes (Canon Fixes)

- **Whiterun**: The Battle of Whiterun has **not** begun; Balgruuf remains **officially neutral**.
- **Galmar Stone-Fist**: Alive and active; prior "Galmar killed" references were from a retired PC timeline.
- **Thieves Guild bleedthrough**: Prior Goldenglow progress does **not** apply to Oskern.

## MID-SESSION CHECKPOINT (Repository-State Snapshot)

This checkpoint is a canon-alignment snapshot intended to keep the repo/export consistent with played fiction:

- **Winterhold → College Courtyard → Saarthal expedition staging** is the active opening.
- **Student NPC stat sheets + bios** are present/verified.
- **Civil War timeline** corrected: Whiterun neutral; battle approaching.
- **Campaign state** updated to reflect:
  - expedition lead = Oskern
  - expedition team = Onmund / Brelyna / J'zargo
  - compel resolution recorded
  - scene aspects + logistics clock seeded

## Next Session Preview

The team departs the College for Saarthal. The first real question isn't "what's down there?" — it's **how quickly the situation forces Oskern to choose between caution and speed** while three students (each with their own ego + fear cocktail) try not to die on his watch.

## Courtyard Leadership & Wolves on the Road

### Courtyard Speech - Role Assignments
Following the initial setup, Oskern stood before the assembled students in the College courtyard. The expedition south required organization, and as the son of a war hero and a lord of noble lineage, command came naturally—even if it drew unwanted attention.

**Role Assignments**:
- **Scouts**: Faster students tasked with ranging ahead
- **Rear Guard**: Watchful students protecting the column's back
- **Core Formation**: Main group with supply packs
- **Oskern**: Front leadership position

The speech was measured but confident. Students who had been uncertain now had purpose. The formation took shape with surprising discipline.

### Mechanics Block

**Scene Aspect Created Earlier**: "Signed for Their Safety"
- **Created by**: Oskern (prior to courtyard scene)
- **Free Invokes**: 1
- **Notes**: PC declared responsibility for student safety during expedition planning; promise carries weight.

**Compel Accepted**: "Prove You're Worthy of the Dragon of Haafingar"
- **Fate Point Gained**: +1 FP (total: 2 FP)
- **Scene Aspect Created**: "All Eyes on Cindershroud" (GM-controlled, 1 free invoke)
- **Effect**: Oskern's command presence and noble bearing drew attention from everyone present. His reputation now precedes him on this journey.

**Rapport Roll - Create Advantage**: "Calm Under Command"
- **Roll**: +1 on 4dF + Rapport +3 + 2 (invoke "Signed for Their Safety") = +6 vs. Difficulty 2
- **Result**: Success with Style
- **Free Invoke Consumed**: Invoked "Signed for Their Safety" to ensure success
- **Scene Aspect Created**: "Calm Under Command" (2 free invokes)
- **Effect**: Students are organized, roles are clear, formation discipline is reinforced

**Scene Aspect Updated**:
- "Signed for Their Safety" → free invokes reduced to 0 (consumed in Rapport roll)

### Travel Beat: Wolves on the Road

As the expedition descended from Winterhold's frozen heights toward the winding road south, the landscape opened into snow-swept tundra. The cold bit hard, but the formation held.

Then the scouts spotted movement: **ice wolves**, pale as death, shadowing the expedition from rocky outcrops. They didn't attack—not yet—but their presence was unmistakable. Yellow eyes gleamed in the failing light.

The students tensed. Oskern's hand moved instinctively to the Staff of Cinders. The wolves kept pace, watching, waiting.

**Threat Level**: Moderate (wolves are tracking, not yet hostile)
**Next Beat**: Decide whether to press forward, confront the pack, or adjust route
