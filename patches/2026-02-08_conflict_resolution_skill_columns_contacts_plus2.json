    "Column advancement rule allows skills to be raised without requiring pyramid reshaping",
    "This change resolves potential confusion about whether Athletics needs to be demoted when Contacts is raised",
    "Under column rules, the character can have multiple skills at the same rank without strict pyramid enforcement",
    "The only limit is the current skill cap (typically +4 at character creation, can increase with Major Milestones)",
    "This makes Significant Milestones more impactful and character growth more flexible",
    "Insaerndel's skill distribution after advancement: 1 Great, 2 Good, 4 Fair, 3 Average",
    "While this breaks the strict Fate Core pyramid (1/2/3/4), column advancement is a common Fate variant",

    "pyramid_vs_column": "Column advancement is more forgiving and commonly used in Fate campaigns with extended play",
    "backward_compatibility": "Previous milestone expenditures remain valid; this clarifies future advancement rules"
