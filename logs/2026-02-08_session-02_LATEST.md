- Recovered valuable papers including Black-Briar honey contracts and a mysterious Pale-linked shipping note

**Message Delivery Phase:**
- Set three of Goldenglow's prized beehives ablaze
- The controlled burns sent Maven's message: "unseen hands" can reach anywhere
- Executed clean exfiltration before full alarm was raised

**Debrief:**
- Returned to the Ragged Flagon in Riften
- Delivered the take to Mercer Frey
- Received payment and Guild recognition
