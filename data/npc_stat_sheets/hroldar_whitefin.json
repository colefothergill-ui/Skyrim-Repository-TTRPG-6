  "notes": "Hroldar \"Whitefin\" is a Pale-born courier who operates as a node in the Ivory Thread—an off-book delivery lattice that moves people, paper, and secrets through Skyrim's seams. He's not loyal to causes; he's loyal to survival, leverage, and whoever pays without bringing heat to his doorstep. Maven uses people like him when she wants plausible deniability. The Arisann lead points to him as a controlled choke-point: he either knows where Arisann went, who hired the transfer, or which relay received the next handoff.",
