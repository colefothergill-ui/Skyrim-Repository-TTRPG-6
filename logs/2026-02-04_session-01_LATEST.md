## MID-SESSION CHECKPOINT — 2026-02-05 (A1-S4 → A1-S5)

### Where we are
- **Act/Scene:** Act 1 — **A1-S5**
- **Location:** Whiterun — **West Wall Checkpoints (Fog Line)**
- **Objective:** Exploit Stormcloak rout; lock Imperial checkpoints; keep Hadvar alive; manage Battle-Born inquiry fallout.

### What just happened (high impact)
- **Hadvar stabilized** (Restoration) and secured behind a keyed ward: **Sigil-Sealed Stairwell**.
- **Quagmire clairvoyance** revealed Galmar's approach through the fog; Insaerndel executed a clean ambush and **slew Galmar Stone-Fist**.
- Stormcloak huscarls attempted retaliation/recovery; the immediate melee ended with Stormcloaks **conceding the west wall** and falling back.
- Insaerndel seized **battlefield-proof** (Galmar's war-knot haft-wrap authority signet + field marks) and used **Scholar's Eloquence** to announce Galmar's fall, shattering enemy morale.
- Insaerndel issued rapid tactical orders, turning the rout into a controlled retreat: **Imperial checkpoints established** and rally nodes crushed.

### Major choices (player-driven)
- Chose **rout-control over massacre**: forced retreat/surrender cascade rather than chasing kills.
- Accepted exposure cost: **Compel — "Famous in the Wrong Circles"** (public Altmer mage presence + battlefield speech).

### Mechanical & state changes (applied)
- **Insaerndel Fate Points:** **4 → 1**
- **Imperial Legion Trust:** **2/10 → 5/10**
- **Dream Catcher Search (Thalmor):** **1/8 → 2/8**
- **Battle-Born Quiet Inquiry:** **3/4 → 4/4 (COMPLETED)**
- **Civil War clocks:** Imperial dominance **2/10 → 3/10**, Stormcloak momentum **5/10 → 4/10**

### Inventory additions (Insaerndel)
- Galmar war-knot haft wrap (authority signet)
- Wax strip (field authority mark)
- Vellum scrap (battle map fragment)

- **A1-S5 | Combat → Aftermath | Whiterun — Western Barricade Parapet / Hadvar's Nook**
