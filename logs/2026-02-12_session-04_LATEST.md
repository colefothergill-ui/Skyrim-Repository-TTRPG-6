### Scene Overview
**Location:** Riften → The Pale — Nightgate Pass Approach (snow road)

**Outcome:** Ambushed Thalmor checkpoint; staged Stormcloak false-flag; acquired warhorse and documents; divined Nightcaller Temple as destination

---

### Narrative Summary

Following the successful completion of the Dampened Spirits job and Maven Black-Briar's revelation about the Ivory Thread courier network, Insaerndel departed Riften to travel north to The Pale. The objective: meet Hroldar 'Whitefin' at Nightgate Pass and follow the trail to Arisann.

**Journey North: Riften to The Pale**

The journey from Riften through the Rift Hold and toward The Pale required traversing main roads where Thalmor patrols were known to operate. Despite the risk, speed was essential.

**Thalmor Justiciar Checkpoint Encounter**

En route to Nightgate Pass, Insaerndel encountered a Thalmor checkpoint:
- Justiciar leading the checkpoint with supporting squad (2 soldiers, 1 archer)
- Standard document inspection protocol being conducted on travelers
- Cart-horse tethered to checkpoint wagon

**Decision Point:** Rather than attempt to bluff through with forged papers or avoid the checkpoint (losing time), Insaerndel chose direct action.

**Combat Resolution: Checkpoint Ambush**

The party initiated combat, taking the Thalmor forces by surprise:
- **Justiciar eliminated** — Command structure broken
- **Two soldiers eliminated** — Close combat engagement
- **Archer eliminated** — Ranged threat neutralized
- **One survivor retained** — Intentionally left alive for false-flag operation

**False-Flag Operation: Stormcloak Staging**

Following the elimination of most checkpoint personnel:
1. **Scene Staging**: Arranged bodies and evidence to suggest Stormcloak ambush
2. **Memory Rewrite**: Used illusion magic to rewrite the survivor's memory of events
3. **Evidence Planting**: Placed Stormcloak-affiliated markers and removed Thalmor documentation
4. **Survivor Release**: Memory-altered survivor allowed to flee and report "Stormcloak attack"

**Strategic Intent:** 
- Delay Thalmor pursuit by misdirecting blame to Stormcloak forces
- Buy time before the deception potentially collapses
- Thalmor Search Clock consequence: If false-flag holds, pursuit delayed; if exposed, clock jumps +2

**Assets Acquired:**
- **Thalmor Justiciar Documentation**: Patrol orders and seal-codes useful for route spoofing
- **Stamped Travel Writ**: Aldmeri Dominion papers, forged/repurposed from checkpoint
- **Warhorse**: Commandeered cart-horse (hardy, trained, suspicious of fire)

### Clairvoyance: Locating Whitefin

With time bought by the checkpoint operation, Insaerndel used **Spell of Clairvoyance** to locate Hroldar 'Whitefin':

**Divination Result:**
- Vision revealed a "decrepit fortress overlooking Dawnstar"
- Location interpretation: **Nightcaller Temple** (known ruin near Dawnstar coast)
- Connection to Whitefin: Former smuggler/courier likely using abandoned temple as safe harbor

**Clock Advancement:**
- **Search for Arisann Clock**: Advanced from 5/8 → **6/8**
- Trigger: Clairvoyance provided credible location lead (+1)

### Session 04 Mid-Session Status

**Current Location:** The Pale — Nightgate Pass Approach (snow road)  
**Next Objective:** Reach Nightcaller Temple to find Hroldar 'Whitefin' and advance Arisann's trail

**Scene Flags Set:**
- `session04_started`
- `session04_departed_riften`
- `session04_justiciar_checkpoint_ambushed`
- `session04_justiciar_and_squad_eliminated`
- `session04_checkpoint_false_flag_stormcloak`
- `session04_checkpoint_survivor_memory_rewritten`
- `session04_thalmor_documents_acquired`
- `session04_warhorse_acquired`
- `session04_whitefin_location_divined`
- `session04_nightcaller_temple_targeted`

**World Consequences:**
- 4 Thalmor forces eliminated (Justiciar + 3 squad members)
- False-flag operation creates volatile situation with potential long-term consequences
- Acquired mount increases travel efficiency going forward

**Major Choice Recorded:**
> "Ambushed a Thalmor Justiciar checkpoint en route to the Pale; staged a Stormcloak false-flag scene, rewrote the lone survivor's memory, seized Justiciar documents, and took the cart-horse as a mount."

### Notes & Compels

**Active Complications:**
- False-flag deception is a time-bomb: if Thalmor investigators detect the illusion magic or contradictions in the survivor's story, consequences will be severe
- Nightcaller Temple is a known dangerous location (Vaermina-linked, potential hostile forces)
- Traveling with a commandeered Thalmor horse may draw attention in civilized areas

**Potential Future Compels:**
- "No Witnesses" — If the checkpoint deception collapses prematurely
- "Informants Everywhere" — Word of the checkpoint attack spreads
- "Dominion Blackmail Hook" — Thalmor documentation creates leverage opportunity
