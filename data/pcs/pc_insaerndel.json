    "Eloquent Scholar: Because Insaerndel has spent years amid the Summerset Isles honing his Scholarly poise, Spycraft and the art of Speech from his former Aldmeri Sophisticates. Preferring to think every word through carefully, and apply his intellect in personable moments of persuasion. Insaerndel may use Lore to Overcome in place of Rapport or Deceive 4dF rolls when addressing Courts, Fellow Wizards, Respectable Merchants, and the Aristocracy. If the 4dF results in SWS he gains a free Boost: 'Charming Intellectual' that he may use through the duration of the scene (Can only benefit from this Boost Once Per Scene).",

If the Athletics roll results in a SWS, via utilizing this stunt to one of the aforementioned items formerly mentioned. Insaerndel may immediately choose whether or not to move one additional zone on that turn.",
    "Spell of Clairvoyance: Because of Insaerndel's tie to Quagmire and study of Vaermina's Mirrors of Memory, once per scene he may Create an Advantage with Lore at +2 by briefly tethering his mind to Oblivion. On success, he receives a clear divination and may state one plausible, narrow claim that becomes true in the narrative (it must not contradict established canon, and should create advantage rather than instantly resolve a major arc). On Success with Style, he also creates the aspect 'One Step Ahead' with 2 free invokes.",
    "Spell of Veils: Because Insaerndel completed the Quagmire Mirror Trial 'Veils' and learned to wear illusion like a second skin, once per scene he may Create an Advantage with Lore to project a mundane disguise (face, voice, and clothing) that holds up under casual scrutiny. On success, place the situational aspect 'Veiled Identity' with 1 free invoke; on Success with Style, gain 2 free invokes. Anyone actively trying to pierce the Veil must Overcome with Notice or Will against your Lore result. If you take Physical stress or a consequence while Veiled, the disguise flickers and you lose the remaining free invokes (the aspect may remain, but without free invokes)."

  "backstory": "**Civil War Entry**: Insaerndel's Response: \"One might call it irony, spending all your time hiding away from the Thalmor amongst the people whom you betrayed them for originally, only to end up fighting those same people in a Civil War perpetuated by the Empire\u2019s poor negotiation skills. However, I call it fate. Spend enough time in the anals of Vaermina\u2019s Daedric Realm of Quagmire. Walking the twisted museum of Dreams, Memories, and Events yet to befall Tamriel. Only then will you come to understand that one\u2019s story is defined forevermore by the thing that matured them. For example, take Tiber Septim or Hjalti, depending on whether you\u2019re keen on upsetting Nord scholars or not, I know I am. He was defined by his conquest, one that I can assure you, he did not intend to bring to ALL of Tamriel, yet there he was, establishing the 3rd Empire all the same. For me, that was War. \u2018The Great War\u2019 to be exact. My Sister, Arisann, and I. Being brought up deep into our parents\u2019 Cult of Daedric worship of Vaermina, before being rescued by the Thalmor Justiciar\u2019s, and branded heretical children in need of reforming. Tends to make you feel not only indebted, but more than willing to carry out atrocities in the name of being called \u2018worthy\u2019.  So when the Great War broke out, my Sister and I had been dispatched under General Naarifin, acting as his Nightblade scouts in Cyrodil. As a relatively young Altmer, she and I, for the longest time, bought into the continual victories against the Empire as nothing more than confirmation to the propaganda that the Empire of the false Man-God Tiber Septim\u2019s dynasty was indeed dead. It was only when she and I began to have joint dreams of walking through what seemed to be a myriad of other Altmer individuals' memories that the truth was laid bare.  Yes, I mean joint dreams, as in we were in the same dream each night together. One\u2019s that had revealed numerous lies fed to us since we were \u2018saved\u2019 from our parents. Like the fact that the Thalmor were the ones who had used their Illusion Magicka to blot out and hide the Khajiit Moons over Elswyr, or the fact that the Thalmor did not stop the Oblivion Crisis of the 3rd Era. Lastly, and perhaps the final straw for us both, our good General, it was revealed, was in possession of the Daedric Artifact of Vaermina\u2019s Orb. Hmph, perhaps my mark of maturity is actually defined in its irony. For the very same Daedra we were saved from as children, had tipped us off to the delusion, and propagandistic brainwashing our compatriots were under. Worse yet, General Naarifin planned to use the Artifact to bring forth a prophetic invasion from Quagmire and effectively quash the entirety of the Empire, and the rest of Man from Tamriel. It was then that we defected to the Cyrodilic army, informed the Emperor of the General\u2019s plans, the Orb, and all that we knew of the Dominion\u2019s plots. Resulting in the forgotten champion destroying the Orb, or hiding it, like I think happened. Which also had the effect of the Thalmor\u2019s scrys deducing our betrayal; The Dream Catchers of Dusk, they called us. A name that has persisted on wanted posters to this day. Fortunately, the Emperor was kind enough, after the peace treaties were signed, to relocate my Sister and me to Skyrim, where we both were given aliases, meager trusts, and jobs as consultants to the Court Wizard of Mistveil Keep in the Rift. What happened to Arisann? She went mad, started believing Vaermina was actually calling her to the Pale after reading the only memento of Summerset we still had, our Father\u2019s spellbook. One night, she got up and disappeared into the Rift wilds, leaving the spell tome behind. Shortly after, the Trust the Emperor had given us had run dry, and Jarl Laila\u2019s frugalness continued. Leaving me to end up becoming friends with the local conman, Brynjolf. I was always good at spywork; being a Thief is no different. Besides, I have come to love Bryn\u2019s little outfit. I have found kinship for the first time in my life. Oh, and the Septims are quite fine too. Why tell you all this? You asked how I came to be involved in the Civil War, yes? I told you, Fate, but if you really need to ask. Then you mustn\u2019t have been listening well enough, because this Civil War is bigger than Nords versus the Empire. It\u2019s being perpetuated by the same Sociopaths who would wipe away moons from the sky to scare a bunch of cats! While circumstances with the Guild will always be my first obligation. If I am able to turn us a profit, and bury a dreamblade in the Dominion\u2019s chest while doing it, then settle a civil matter, I will.\"\n\n**Civil War Stance**: Insaerndel's Response: \"I support filling my pockets with the wealth that for once, is dictated only by how well I perform at the things that I do. Not to mention, I owe Brynjolf for holding me aloft when my Sister had left. If not for him, I too may have fallen to headlong into my Scholarly pursuits of Daedra, and Vaermina, before finding myself wandering into the wilderness as well. All that being said, I truly do not care who wins. Just as long as the Victor, turns his head toward the true enemy, the Thalmor in Summerset, and the one's within Skyrim's Holds.\"\n\n**Motivation**: Insaerndel's Response: \"What drives me? So many things, in truth. If you'd like the superficial answer: Coin, Compatriots, and womanly affections. The not so surface-level response, would be: Paying back Brynjolf by elevating the Guild to it's rightful place as king of the Underground. Garnering the respect my public persona deserves amongst the inhabitants of the Rift. Continuing my research in Daedrology, searching for my Sister, and becoming someone who can call himself worthy. Not expecting it to be ordained upon him by some pretencious snob in a Black Trench coat. It'd also be nice to stop looking over my shoulder every chance I get. For those Dream Catcher wanted posters, I hear, have even made their way into Markarth of all places! Fuck you too, Jarl Igmund.\"\n\n**Connections**: Insaerndel Response: \"I was once asked to Whiterun with my Sister after shortly arriving in Skyrim. We met with Jarl Baalgruuf the Greater, whom asked us to tell us about the Dominion upon Summerset, and of their counterpart; The Thalmor. In our talks, I came to admire the man greatly. For he seemed to be a man who led from not what power he could abscond, but what he could do for his citizenry. After our encounter, well, he certainly seems to have taken some of what we said to heart. For the Thalmor remain outside the Hold, and because of that, it remains a place where I can freely travel without fear.\"",
