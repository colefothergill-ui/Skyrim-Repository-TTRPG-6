## Session Summary

Session 0 pivots the campaign's opening to the **College of Winterhold**, with Oskern already recognized as an **Adept** and pulled immediately into a "you're responsible for the students" kind of situation.

Mirabelle Ervine assigns Oskern as the **expedition lead** for Tolfdir's Saarthal dig, with three students attached to the team:
- **Onmund** (frontline ward support)
- **Brelyna Maryon** (midline utility / stabilization)
- **J'zargo** (rearline artillery / "please don't explode us")  

Oskern signs out a **College-Issued Field Kit**, accepts a **Standing Stone Compel** (Atronach Stone: magicka-starved surge), and clears the immediate exhaustion by downing a **Magicka potion** before departure.

## Scenes Played

### Scene: College Courtyard — Saarthal Briefing
**Scene ID**: `A1_S00_COLLEGE_SAARTHAL_BRIEFING`  
**Objective**: Lead the Saarthal expedition team; reach the dig site and keep the students alive.

**Key beats**
- Mirabelle lays down the rule: the College can tolerate chaos, but not *dead students*. Oskern is accountable.
- Oskern takes the issued satchel and immediately prepares the squad like a battlefield unit (treating the expedition like a disciplined field unit).
- **Compel (Accepted)**: Atronach Stone — sudden magicka-starved surge hits as preparations begin.
  - **Resolution**: Oskern drinks a Magicka potion to clear the immediate exhaustion.
- Oskern establishes expedition formation doctrine and assigns combat roles.

## Fate + Mechanics Snapshot

### Compel Log
- **Atronach Stone: Magicka-Starved Surge** — *Accepted*  
  **Fiction**: the standing stone "eats" the ambient flow; Oskern feels it like thirst behind the eyes.  
  **Cost/Outcome**: cleared with a Magicka potion before leaving the courtyard.

### Scene Aspects (Created)
- **College-Issued Field Kit** (2 free invokes) — signed out supplies (scrolls, potions, emergency gear).
- **Shield-Wall Doctrine** (2 free invokes) — Oskern's formation order for the student team.
- **Signed for Their Safety** (1 free invoke) — Mirabelle's directive and accountability pressure.

### Active Scene Clock
- **Saarthal Expedition Logistics**: 1/4  
  *(1=briefed+supplied; 2=arrive; 3=breach wards; 4=secure exit.)*

---

## Continuity Notes (Canon Fixes)

- **Whiterun**: The Battle of Whiterun has **not** begun; Balgruuf remains **officially neutral**.
- **Galmar Stone-Fist**: Alive and active; prior "Galmar killed" references were from a retired PC timeline.
- **Thieves Guild bleedthrough**: Prior Goldenglow progress does **not** apply to Oskern.

## MID-SESSION CHECKPOINT (Repository-State Snapshot)

This checkpoint is a canon-alignment snapshot intended to keep the repo/export consistent with played fiction:

- **Winterhold → College Courtyard → Saarthal expedition staging** is the active opening.
- **Student NPC stat sheets + bios** are present/verified.
- **Civil War timeline** corrected: Whiterun neutral; battle approaching.
- **Campaign state** updated to reflect:
  - expedition lead = Oskern
  - expedition team = Onmund / Brelyna / J'zargo
  - compel resolution recorded
  - scene aspects + logistics clock seeded

## Next Session Preview

The team departs the College for Saarthal. The first real question isn't "what's down there?" — it's **how quickly the situation forces Oskern to choose between caution and speed** while three students (each with their own ego + fear cocktail) try not to die on his watch.
